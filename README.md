# Programming-Patterns
This repository is for the programming patterns seen in POO
Design Patterns in C++: This collection has examples of common design patterns. Each folder is for a specific pattern and includes code examples with comments to help understand how each pattern works :)

Contents:

Singleton Pattern: Shows how to make sure a class has only one instance and can be accessed globally.

Factory Pattern: Demonstrates creating objects without specifying their exact class.

Abstract Factory Pattern: Illustrates creating related objects without specifying their exact classes.

Builder Pattern: Separates building a complex object from its representation, allowing different representations.

Adapter Pattern: Makes incompatible interfaces work together by converting one class's interface into what the client expects.

Prototype Pattern: Creates new objects by duplicating existing ones.

Decorator Pattern: Dynamically adds extra responsibilities to objects.

Composite Pattern: Treats both individual objects and groups of objects the same way."
